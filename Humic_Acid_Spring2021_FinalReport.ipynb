        "The Spring 2021 Humic Acid Removal subteam is centered around exploring the relationships between various parameters, such as pH and temperature, and the optimal coagulant dosage in order to effectively remove the humic acid from the water in substandard conditions. Based on previous work, for a sample of untreated water at room temperature, the optimal coagulate dosage is around 1.5 mg/L. Expanding on this information, by determining the optimal coagulate concentration with varying pH and temperature, a calibration curve can be created to determine the desired amount of coagulant with specific humic acid concentrations in AguaClara plants.\n",

        "## **Introduction**\n",
        "The subteam’s goal is to develop methods to remove harmful dissolved Natural Organic Matter (NOM), specifically humic acid, from influent water in an AguaClara plant. \n",
        "\n",
        "NOM exists in both ground and surface water. It is dipolar and can serve as a nutrient for bacteria, viruses, and pathogens. Additionally, some NOM produces carcinogenic byproducts during chlorination.The subteam will be using humic acid (HA) as a representative substance for NOM.  Humic acid reacts with chlorine to form chloroform, which is harmful to humans (Kopfler, F et al.). To minimize risk, it is imperative to remove NOM from water. However, there is not a robust model predicting how NOM behaves in water. Consequently, there are no effective treatment methods for NOM-water removal. Limited knowledge in this area affects drinking water treatment significantly. Many researchers believe the negative effects of NOM in water might call for a need to increase coagulant doses. The cost of coagulant and its potential negative effects in excess set a maximum limit for the dose that can be added during the water treatment process. One such negative effect is that too much coagulant prevents flocculation. \n",
        "\n",
        "At the AguaClara plant in Gracias, Honduras, influent water contains an unusually high concentration of dissolved NOM (specifically HA) while containing relatively little clay. This composition has presented issues. Generally, suspended clay particles in influent water serve as catalysts for flocs to form, allowing NOM to coagulate and leave solution. With little clay in the influent water, floc formation is slower and less probable, making it difficult to encourage flocculation of dissolved NOM. In the past, this sub-team's goal was to determine whether increasing the dosage of coagulant (specifically PACl) would facilitate better flocculation of NOM. In the Fall 2019 semester, this subteam demonstrated that it is possible to use PACl to encourage flocculation of dissolved HA and determined a few potentially optimal PACl dosages to do so. \n",
        "\n",
        "For the Fall 2021 semester, the subteam aims to retest the optimal PACl dosages for humic acid removal that were determined by past team members. The subteam will also consider that the pH of the water could affect the dosage of the PACl needed and will investigate how to optimize the dosage with pH variation. Additionally, the subteam will consider the practicality of adding clay into the water in order to assist in flocculation for the plant scale humic acid removal. The subteam hopes to make meaningful progress towards developing a reliable method for HA removal, and towards applying this method to the general removal of NOM. \n",

        "## **Literature Review**\n",
        "Natural organic matter (NOM) can pose dangers to water quality. It causes discoloration, taste and odor problems, and biological growth in distribution systems. It’s presence increases the probability of heavy metal intoxication in freshwater systems, which poses a threat to communities relying on said bodies of water. There is a strong positive association between high amounts of natural organic matter and high sludge volumes post-water treatment.  Matilainen et al.(2010) suggests that optimized coagulation is the major treatment option in decreasing NOM level. However, the nature of NOM has significant effects on the removal efficiency of coagulation. NOM particle removal is affected by several factors such as pH and temperature. In this case, a lower than average pH affects the electrical charge for humic acid particles, which could affect their interactivity with the coagulant used.\n",
        "\n",
        "As suggested by Zhang et al. (2008), polyaluminium chloride presents a viable coagulant to combat NOM (specifically humic acid) contamination in bodies of water. Usual aluminium coagulants are usually efficient, but PaCl has demonstrated to have higher efficiency despite its low cost. Zhang et al. (2008) also warns that overuse of PaCl to treat water could lead to a contamination of aluminium in the bodies of water, which would then lead it to require additional treatment. \n",
        "\n",
        "As shown with the studies conducted by Soh et al. (2008), NOMs (such as humic acid) can be subdivided into different categories based on their hydrophobic or hydrophilic properties (very hydrophobic acids, slightly hydrophobic acids, charged hydrophilics, and neutral hydrophilics). During this study, it was supported that aluminium coagulation would not suffice for all types of NOM particle removal treatment, as some of the NOMs were not interacting with it. This directly ties with what Zhang et al. (2008) argued in favor of the use of PaCl as a much more viable alternative. Soh’s study also suggests that common water treatments have not shown to improve in effectiveness with increased dosage quantities, which further supports the use of PaCl over aluminium as coagulant. \n",
        "\n",
        "Research has been done by Yingda Du, former Cornell University student, on how effluent turbidity is affected by a combination of coagulant concentration and concentration of humic acid. Amongst the relevant discoveries of Du’s research, lies the fact that particle distribution of flocs and effluent turbidity are the major criteria that determines flocculation effectiveness. These factors, in turn, are directly affected by NOM (in this case humic acid) concentration.  Du’s research showed that for influent turbidity at 50 NTU with coagulant dosage ranging from 0.53 mg/L to 2.65 mg/L and humic acid concentration ranging from 0 to 15 mg/L, a series of experiments from Yingda indicate that the coagulant dosage is positively correlated with turbidity reduction and the presence of humic acid greatly increases the effluent turbidity\n",
        "\n",
        " \n",
        "Another finding from Du's report is that the presence of humic acid increases the frequency of smaller particles after flocculation. As humic acid coats coagulant nano-particles, the attachment efficiency of collisions will decrease. Thus, humic acid can change the particle size distribution of the precipitated solids and larger particle formation is greatly inhibited by humic acid. This result indicates that existence of humic acid particles could diminish the performance of the flocculation/sedimentation process with higher effluent turbidity.\n",

        "In past semesters, the humic acid subteam experimented with humic acid dosages of 5 mg/L and 10 mg/L with various coagulant dosages. The team concluded that the optimal dosage for 5 mg/L of humic acid was between 1.6 mg/L and 1.8 mg/L of coagulant, while the 10 mg/L of humic acid was best treated by 1.3 mg/L. From these trials, the team concluded that as humic acid concentration increased coagulant dosage should decrease in order to maximize humic acid removal from the water; therefore, a negative linear relationship between the two variables. The Fall 2019 humic acid subteam began to test humic acid concentrations of 15 mg/L, 20 mg/L, and 25 mg/L; however, had not determined the optimal coagulant dosages for these concentrations. This team did conclude that above 2.1-2.3 mg/L of coagulant, the coagulant became less effective, and therefore, the effectiveness of coagulant levels out as it increases. This team and the Fall 2020 subteam began to confirm the linear results of the previous subteams; however, did not have time to draw conclusions.\n"

After leaving the turbidimeter, coagulant is added to the flow and enters the flocculator. Then the flow goes into the sedimentation tank where flocs are formed, and separated into two directions: the clean water goes through the top part of the sedimentation tank and pumped into the spectrophotometer, effluent turbidimeter and lastly exits the system through the wastewater pipe; the flocs are settled and directly leaves the sedimentation tank and into the wastewater flow. \n"

After reanalyzing the data, their conclusions about the optimal coagulant dosage decreasing with increased humic acid are supported by the figures; however, they are underresearched. The 10 mg/L humic acid removal trials only test 4 coagulant dosages below the optimal dosage for 5 mg/L of humic acid. Without data at higher coagulant dosages, the optimal coagulant dosage cannot be confirmed. In conclusion, the reanalysis of past data demonstrates that the determined linear relationship by past subteams does not have enough supporting experimental data to confirm that there is in fact a negative linear relationship especially when (Du et. al.) research states otherwise. Additionally, not enough trials at 15 mg/L. 20 mg/L and 25 mg/L of humic acid with varying coagulant dosages can be used to confirm or deny the linear relationship. \n",

        "The team this semester has focused on lab procedure and experimental design to smooth the process of getting into the lab once it is available to the team. In constructing the experimental design, the subteam’s initial goal was to test varying coagulant dosages at 15 mg/L, 20 mg/L, and 25 mg/L of humic acid and continue the work of the Fall 2019 subteam. Using the provided python code, the team determined the required ProCoDa inputs for the humic acid, coagulant, and water pumps, in order to test 15 coagulant dosages for the 3 humic acid concentrations. The team expects that the optimal coagulant dosage for each humic acid concentration will be displayed by the graph that minimizes absorbance after reaching a steady-state flow. Additionally, the subteam expects that the data will disprove the relationship found by past subteams between humic acid concentration and coagulant dosage. The optimal coagulant dosage should linearly increase with increasing humic acid concentration. \n",
        "\n",
        "The subteam also identified the expected optimal coagulant dosages for each humic acid concentration based on the negative linear relationship that past subteams identified. For 15 mg/L this value was 1.0 mg/L of coagulant, for 20 mg/L the value was 0.7 mg/L of coagulant and for 25 mg/L, this value was expected to be 0.4 mg/L of coagulant. Based on these values, the team concluded that 0.4 mg/L of coagulant seems like a small dosage to treat such a high concentration of humic acid; therefore, the subteam predicts further experimentation will show that this dosage is in fact too low and that the relationship is incorrect. \n",
        "\n",
        "The subteam also investigated the Procoda Method and set points written by past semester's teams. Without the physical pumps and experimental setup, the team optimized the requirements for each set point so that it would theoretically run smoothly in lab; however, there were requirements such as com port 1 that were selected for certain set points that made the data not match. The subteam would hope to investigate this discrepancy and determined whether this requirement is necessary for the pump set points once the team gets into lab.\n"
